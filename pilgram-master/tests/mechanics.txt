Pilgram is an *idle adventure RPG with multiplayer elements* and it has quite a few mechanics.
Let's tackle them in sections:

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Players*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
that's you! Players are the most complex part of Pilgram in terms of stats, so here's a short recap:

üî∑ *Level*: Shows how experienced your character is, influences your success rate on quests (formula follows later).

üî∑ *Boromian Alloy*: The money of the world of Borom.

üî∑ *XP*: Reach a certain amount and your character will level up. Doing anything in the game grants you XP.
The amount of xp required to *level up* is calculated with the *formula*:
`XP = 100 x lv^2 + 1000 x lv`, where `lv` is your current level.

üî∑ *Gear level*: You current gear level, influences your success rate on quests.
Upgrading your gear costs money, the *upgrade cost* is calculated with the following *formula*:
`COST = 50 x lv^2 + 1000 x lv` where `lv` is the current level of your gear.

üî∑ *Home level*: You current home level, influences events rewards (formula follows later).
Upgrading your home costs money, the *upgrade cost* is calculated with the *formula*:
`COST = 100 x lv^2 + 5000 x lv` where `lv` is the current level of your home.

üî∑ *Artifact pieces*: Used to assemble artifacts, explained later.

üî∑ *Renown*: Does nothing, used for rankings. It is gained by playing non-gambling mini-games & completing quests.

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Quests*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Your main source of income & xp. *Succeeding in a quest* depends on a D20 throw:

if you *roll 1* you *fail* the quest.
if you *roll 19* or more you *succeed* the quest.
For the *in between numbers*, the minimum value that your roll has to beat is calculated using the *formula*:

`MIN ROLL = 6 + zl - pl + (1.2 x zl - (gl + pl) / 2) x sqrt((4 / zl) x (qn - 1))`
where `zl` = zone level, `pl` = player level, `gl` = gear level, `qn` = quest number.

_Note: quest number is the amount of quests you did in the zone._
_Note: zone level is the minimum required level for the zone, NOT the zone number._

Once you fail a quest you can't retry it, but don't worry about it since there is literally an infinite amount of them.

The formula for quest rewards is a bit simpler:
`MULT = zl x qn + (guild level)
rand = rand(1 to 50)
XP REWARD = 950 x MULT + rand
MONEY REWARD = 760 x MULT + rand`

Quests also provide *prestige* for the guild you are currently in.
The amount of prestige a quest gives upon successful completion is determined by the *formula*:

`PRESTIGE = zone level + quest number`

Quest duration follows the formula:

`DURATION = 1 day + (1 hour x zone level) + (2 hours x quest number) + (3 hours x rand(0 to zone level))`

On quest success you have a 20% chance of finding a piece of an artifact (explained later).

use the command `explain mechanics 2` to continue

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Guilds*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Clubs for you and your friends! Or ways to "compete" with others.
Guilds can hold 4 players per level; The maximum level for guilds is 10 (so 40 players).
Creating a guild costs 1000, but upgrading it is extremely expensive:

`COST = 10000 x lv^2 + 1000 x lv` where `lv` = guild level

Guild prestige does nothing: the higher it is, the higher your guild will be on the ranking. That's it.

The *tourney score* is used to compete in the biweekly Guild Tourney.
It is reset every 2 weeks & at reset time the members in the *top 3* guilds get some money as a reward:

1st = 10000 Boromian Alloy
2nd = 5000 Boromian Alloy
3rd = 1000 Boromian Alloy

an artifact piece is also rewarded to the owner of the first placed guild

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Events*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
The random updates you are sent every once in a while.
You get events even while not on a quest, so you can still (really slowly) level up even by staying in town.
Both xp & money rewards follow the formula:

if the player's level is higher or equal to (zone level - 3):
`REWARD = (zl + 2 + hl) * rand(1 to 10)`
else
`EWARD = (2 + hl) x rand(1 to 10)`
where `zl` = zone level, `hl` = player home level.

Sometimes you can meet other players going through their own journey.
This gives you XP following the formula:

if not in town:
`XP REWARD = 10 x zone id x highest level between the 2 players meeting`
if in town:
`XP REWARD = 10`

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Minigames*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
You can play these to earn some more money & xp, plus they are fun!
We won't go into detail here, you can use the command `list minigames` to see which minigames are available.
Then use the command `explain minigame [minigame name]` to get more info about each minigame.
The use the command `play [minigame name]` to, well, play the minigame.

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*Artifacts*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Exceedingly rare mysterious artifacts you can craft with 10 artifact pieces, each artifact is unique & increases your maximum eldritch power by 10 (starts from 0).
You can use your eldritch power to cast spells.
Spells always use all your power; The more power they use, the more powerful they are.

‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è*QTEs*‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è
Acronym for "Quick Timed Events", are small prompts that you have a chance of getting when you get a notification for an event.
Use the command `qte` [option] to respond to it before it expires.
QTEs expire when the next event is sent to you, so you should have plenty of time to do them :)
